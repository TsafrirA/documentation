# Introduction

IBM Quantum&trade; maintains the worldâ€™s most advanced fleet of quantum systems, with seven [utility-scale](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/new-ibm-quantum-systems-on-the-ibm-cloud/) quantum systems, and more on the way. These systems demonstrate unparalleled reliability, with >95% uptime across the fleet of quantum systems - and unmatched stability, with two-qubit gate error fluctuations no larger than 0.001 over timescales measured in months[^1].

## The run phase

In the run phase, you send your quantum program to be executed on a quantum system. This section provides information about IBM Quantum hardware and how to connect to the instances that provide access to quantum systems. You can find details about estimating job run time and cost, running within a session, and more. 

The steps during the run phase are:

1. Using your account credentials, authenticate to the channel of your choice ([IBM Quantum Platform](../start/setup-channel#ibm-quantum-platform) or [IBM Cloud&reg;](../start/setup-channel#ibm-cloud)).
2. Choose a system or simulator.
3. Send a job to a system or simulator.
4. View job results.
