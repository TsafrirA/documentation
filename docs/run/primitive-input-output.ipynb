    "This page gives an overview of the inputs and outputs of the V2 primitives implemented by Qiskit Runtime which will execute workloads on an IBM Quantum backend. These interfaces provide you with the ability to efficiently define vectorized workloads by using a data structure known as a Primitive Unified Bloc (PUB). These PUBs are used as the fundamental unit of work which a backend needs in order to execute these workloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once these workloads are submitted as jobs to the IBM Quantum platform, they are executed and the data returned is dependent on the PUBs which were executed, as well as any error mitigation or suppression options that were defined when the primitive was invoked."

    "To ensure faster and more efficient results, as of 1 March 2024, circuits and observables need to be transformed to only use instructions supported by the system (referred to as *instruction set architecture (ISA)* circuits and observables) before being submitted to the Qiskit Runtime primitives.  See the [transpilation documentation](../transpile) for instructions to transform circuits.  Due to this change, the primitives will no longer perform layout or routing operations.  Consequently, transpilation options referring to those tasks will no longer have any effect. By default, all primitives except Sampler V2 still optimize the input circuits. To bypass all optimization, set `optimization_level=0`.\n",
